# 🧠 GreedyBinner

**GreedyBinner** is an Edge-level(single-machine) adaptive histogram construction framework that balances **accuracy**, **compactness**, and **real-time interpretability**.  
It uses a **greedy binning algorithm** that dynamically merges or splits bins based on data distribution, protecting key quantiles while limiting bin count and width.
